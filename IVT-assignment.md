our contribution consisted of 4 parts:

CI and static techniques:
- Running a static analysis tool and reviewing the reported problems using codacy (Khuderchuluun Erdenechuluun-GTBHX0)
- Performing manual code review on some part of the application(Batsaikhan Khosbayar-L2N9IX)

Testing:
- Creating or extending unit tests (Weheash Ashraf Ahmed Elazab Ahmed-HTAEOU)
- Designing, executing and documenting manual tests (Achref Mekni-RMPSYJ)

we have chosen these tasks since this repository is a collection of libraries and these were
the most efficient CI & static techniques and testing tasks to apply on such repository.

Overview:

Static Analysis:


Manual Code Review:


Manual Testing:

it consists of 2 parts which are Performance Testing that measures the performance(time complexity) of
several functions in the search library & Functional Testing that combines 2 libraries (search+sort)
and tests if their usage seperately and together is efficient and doesnt cause any execution problem 

Unit Testing:
